# Splitting The Bills

This project is a web service that allows tenants to be grouped in with their fellow house mates; the group will represent their house. Upon being in the same house, tenants can create recurring bills or one-time payments, such that their effect on each tenant's balance reflects the amount of money they owe or are owed relative to their fellow tenants.

## Compilation and Execution

Clone the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/mrvicari/splitting-the-bills.git`

Navigate into top level directory and run `mvn clean package`

Start the server with `java -jar target/splitting-the-bills-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

The server will now be running in port 8080
